CSS_Introduction:

class: 	a CSS class selector describes a behavior that is not unique
		many elements can "extend" a class to represent a similiar or even identical behavior
		many elements can be a part of one class

id:		id's in CSS are used to define a unique behavior which differs from any other HTML element
		id's are selectors which can't occur more than once and can only be used on exactly one element
		multiple can't share one id
		id's can only be used once

order:	CSS is being executed line by line in order from top to bottom
		(but keep in mind that different specifications can change values in some cases)
